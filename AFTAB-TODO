Immediate TODOs
1. -"reality" : req.body[member] always translates to one value because of some for loop sync thing maybe
2. - The /expectationreality/addbygoalid route needs to translate the goal id to goal name before passing on to the addExpectationReality function in models/expectationreality.js
3. - Edit goal functionality completely broken
4. - Work on the routes/getvisualizedata.js to read from expectationrealities table, and format in the format that googlecharts requires, and send
5. - Fix colors problem
6. - Add per goal graph in visualize page
7. Tool tip for week
8. Have each graph with a different color
9. Week 21(May 16)
10. Add req.flash for error messages too

Bugs
1. - Breaks when you deactivate a goal, and try and continue
   It's something to do with week-1. Fix would be to have a table where you save the last cumulative expectation and realities of all goals, as opposed to
   searching for week-1. If you discontinue a goal for 5 weeks, and come back, you want to continue from where you left off, not week-1, when you were
   inactive
2. - Homepage's flash always says, 'Successfully tracked goals for Week 20'
3.
