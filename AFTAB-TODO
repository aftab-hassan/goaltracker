Immediate TODOs
1. -"reality" : req.body[member] always translates to one value because of some for loop sync thing maybe
2. - The /expectationreality/addbygoalid route needs to translate the goal id to goal name before passing on to the addExpectationReality function in models/expectationreality.js
3. - Edit goal functionality completely broken
4. - Work on the routes/getvisualizedata.js to read from expectationrealities table, and format in the format that googlecharts requires, and send

Extra features
5. Fix the blue color highlighting thing in the homepage
6. Display goal names and descriptions of a certain happiness level
7. Post in SO, how I can pass on all kinds of values from the front end to the back.
