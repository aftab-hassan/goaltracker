Immediate TODOs
1. -"reality" : req.body[member] always translates to one value because of some for loop sync thing maybe
2. - The /expectationreality/addbygoalid route needs to translate the goal id to goal name before passing on to the addExpectationReality function in models/expectationreality.js
3. - Edit goal functionality completely broken
4. Visualize goals

Extra features
5. Fix the blue color highlighting thing in the homepage
6. Display goal names and descriptions of a certain happiness level
7. Post in SO, how I can pass on all kinds of values from the front end to the back.
